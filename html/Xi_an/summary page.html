From middle 16th century to 1950s, lots of Chinese people decided to emigrate abroad. Initially, people move abroad to do international business conveniently. However, as the change of world pattern, Chinese people do the emigration activities with the desire of pursuing a new life. The emigration waves also cause the indirect culture diffusion. From 1950s to now, China becomes prosperous and strong in peaceful development. More and more Chinese people also choose moving abroad with various purpose, such as learning, travelling and experience a new life. In this process, the ties between the China and the world become closer and closer, and cultural diffusion is becoming more and more frequent. Chinatown as a carrier of fusion culture, has its own unique values. It is no longer just an ethnic enclave of Chinese, but more as a unique symbol of Chinese culture going global and relocation.
