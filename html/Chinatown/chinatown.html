        <p>Manhattan's Chinatown is home to the largest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, and is also one of the oldest Chinese ethnic enclaves. It is one of nine Chinatown neighborhoods in New York, but contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia. As a popular Chinese commercial shopping area and preferred destination for Chinese immigrants in New York, this zone in recent years has also become homeland to Burmese, Vietnamese, Filipinos, and other ethnic groups, and the diversity of economy and culture has been significantly improved. </p>

        <p>Chinatown in Singapore is a dramatic contrast to the rest of the city, from the fragrant smells of traditional cuisine to the red and gold hues running through the neighborhood, a vibrant cultural vibe bursts through the streets. This Chinatown differs from traditional Chinese immigrant enclaves, it is not a living place for Chinese laborers with coolie work anymore, instead, it has been transformed and repackaged as a venue for heritage preservation and tourism industry. Nowadays, the old district is home to various different cultures and is the only Chinatown in the world to boast a Buddhist temple, a mosque and a Hindu temple along a single street.</p>

        <p>This Chinatown is a center of Chinese community in the borough of Westminster, London. With more and more Chinese workers arrived since the late 1960s, the number now reached tens of thousands. There are bakeries, bars, restaurants, clinics, barber shop etc., from the huge Chinese gate to complete street facilities, and to all aspects of life, the Chinatown has become a well-developed commercial pedestrian area. There are various Chinese traditional events being organized every year, such as during Chinese New Year, which features parades with floats, lion dances and live performances, hundreds of red lanterns during the celebrations make for a spectacular sight.</p>

        <h1>Melbourne,<br/>Australia</h1>
        <p>Melbourne's Chinatown is in Little Bourke Street, it is notable as the oldest Chinatown in Australia, the oldest continuous Chinese settlement in Western World, and the longest continuously running Chinatown outside of Asia. In the current district, the cabinet manufacturers and shabby lodges have been disappeared, instead, catering outlets and top restaurants are increasingly established, as well as several Asian grocery stores, Chinese medicine and herbal stores, and other retail outlets with Chinese-inspired goods, and fortunately, the historic characters are preserved within the street scene and low-rise brick buildings. There are also numerous traditional festivals and events all year round, which highlights Chinatown as a popular tourist destination in downtown city.</p>

        <h1>Johannesburg,<br/>South Africa</h1>
        <p>South Africa has the largest Chinese population of any African country, and remains a popular destination for Chinese immigrants coming to Africa. Derrick Avenue in Cyrildene, Johannesburg, hosts South Africa's largest Chinatown. Comparing developed countries and other Asia countries, Chinese immigration in Africa has only increased considerably in the past few decades, which is due to China's relatively rapid incorporation into the global capitalist economy. However, the South African stateâ€™s attitude towards the Chinese ethnic group is complex and conflicted, on the one hand, the South African government needs Chinese investment and political support, hence, opposition to Chinese immigration is restricted. On the other hand, the Chinese pose a significant competitive threat to South African businesses at all tiers. In general, while the business success of the Chinese community has boosted the economic vitality of the host area, it has also resulted in an isolated situation of community and culture, and difficult to blend into its host society.</p>
