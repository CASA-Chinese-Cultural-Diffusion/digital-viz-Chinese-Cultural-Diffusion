## The History of Chinese Cultural Diffusion: People as the Carrier of Culture
The Chinese culture has emerged for thousands of years since Oracle was created in the Shang dynasty. It developed, integrated, and spread out in later millennia and finally, shown to the world. The Chinese carried on their culture in the past millennia, left their homes, crossed national borders, and travelled to Europe, Latin America, Australia, Southeast Asia, North America, and other places. Today, Chinese communities have been established in many countries on continents, and Chinese cultural elements can be easily found worldwide.

Standing at today and trackback, we're interested in how Chinese people move and bring their culture to the world. This project aims to track back the history, and display the process of Chinese culture diffusion, from local to global then to re-local over millennia, starting from the famous ancient city, Chang'an, through various routes, for diverse reasons and backgrounds, spreading over the world and finally being re-located to Chinatowns all over the world.
